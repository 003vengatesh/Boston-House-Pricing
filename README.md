# Boston House Pricing Prediction

Welcome to my Boston House Pricing Prediction project repository! This project focuses on exploratory data analysis and machine learning tasks using the Boston Housing dataset.

## About

This project is aimed at exploring the Boston Housing dataset and building a predictive model for housing prices. Aspiring Data Scientists will find this project insightful for learning data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The Boston Housing dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, Massachusetts. The dataset includes various features such as crime rate, number of rooms, and median value of owner-occupied homes.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your environment:
- pandas==1.3.3
- numpy==1.21.2
- matplotlib==3.4.3
- seaborn==0.11.2
- scikit-learn==0.24.2

You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Model Deployment (optional)

## Files

- `housing.csv`: The dataset file containing housing data.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing all dependencies for this project.
- `regmodel.pkl`: Pickled machine learning model file for deployment.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `Data_Science_Project.ipynb` to follow along with the project.
4. Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the code for your learning and experimentation.
